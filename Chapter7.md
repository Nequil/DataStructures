# Advanced Sorting
## Shellsort
* Based on Insertion Sort
* Easy to Implement
* Not quite O(NlogN), but much faster than O(N^2)
* Not optimum for large files
* N-Sorting
    * Example: 4-sorting sorts positions 0, 4, and 8, then 1, 5, and 9, etc
## Partitioning
* Divides data into two groups
* Key value used to split the data is called a pivot value
    * Anything with a value greater than pivot value goes to right, anything less goes to left
